### CloudVision

The add-on allows you to get a description of the image using artificial intelligence.

It works through Google Chrome OCR and PiccyBot.

Previously, there were Microsoft and Be My Eyes, but the former blocked access, and the latter began to protect themselves from non-official use of the API.

The add-on settings are in the  NVDA menu, parameters, CloudVision Settings.

Keyboard shortcuts:
* NVDA+CTRL+I - get a description of the navigator object or jpg/png file if it is in focus in Windows explorer. If you press twice quickly, the result will appear in the virtual viewer, you can read with arrows, select, copy, and so on;
* NVDA+ALT+F - recognize full screen;
* NVDA+ALT+C - recognize an image from the clipboard;
* NVDA+ALT+A - ask a question to bot  about the last recognized image;
* Copy the last recognized result to the clipboard - the combination is not assigned, you can assign it yourself in the input gestures;
* NVDA+ALT+P - switching prompts (briefly, in detail, your own).
